# Text-Based Game

This repository contains a Python text-based adventure game developed as part of my degree at Southern New Hampshire University. The project demonstrates interactive storytelling, branching logic, and user-driven decision-making while applying fundamental programming concepts such as loops, functions, and conditional statements.

## Features
- Interactive story with multiple branching paths and outcomes
- Decision-driven gameplay based on user input
- Clear, structured Python code suitable for learning and experimentation
- Modular design that can be expanded with additional story elements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Running the Game
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TextBasedGame.git
